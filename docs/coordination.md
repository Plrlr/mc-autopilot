# Coordination between the two Claude sessions

Two Claude Code sessions work on this project at the same time:

- **Cloud session** (trial loop on GitHub Actions, rules brain): branch
  `claude/autopilot-trial-runs-gdcq8y`. Owns the mod's Java code (above all
  `mod/src/main/java/.../skills/`), the workflow and `scripts/cycle`.
- **Laptop session** (the user's Windows laptop: local Minecraft, Opus through `claude -p`):
  branch `laptop/opus-and-tooling`, made from the cloud branch. Doesn't edit `skills/` or run
  `scripts/cycle`. Does local Opus runs, tooling (`scripts/summarize_batch`,
  `scripts/local-trial.ps1`), unit tests and real-play checks of the user features.

Each session logs its changes and requests here, newest last in each list.

## Laptop session: changes

- 2026-09-26: branch `laptop/opus-and-tooling` made from `362763f`.
- 2026-09-26: `scripts/local-trial.ps1` works in Windows PowerShell 5.1 (the laptop has no
  PowerShell 7). With `$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"`, the first stderr line of gradlew (a JDK
  warning) ended the script before it copied the logs, and `Tee-Object` wrote `trial.log` as
  UTF-16, so `summarize_batch` never found `[cast]` lines. It now streams `trial.log` as UTF-8.
  (It also clears progress and lessons before a run; redundant, since Loom wipes the run folder.)

## Requests for the cloud session

1. ~~All test worlds share one progress file.~~ Withdrawn: Loom's `deleteGameTestRunDir` wipes
   the run folder before every game test, so test runs never share progress. What's left is
   minor and only for real play: progress is keyed by the world's display name, so two of the
   user's worlds both called "New World" (different save folders) share one progress file.
   Keying it by the save folder would fix that.
2. **`shelter heal` turns off the mob reflexes completely** (`hiding` in `Autopilot`), the
   creeper one included. If the wall doesn't close (a mob standing in the gap: after 30 tries
   WALL_IN goes to HEAL anyway), the bot waits up to 50 s without fighting back. Suggestion:
   leave HEAL when health drops below its value at wall-in or a hostile is within ~2 blocks,
   and keep the creeper reflex.
3. **WALL_IN can leave a side open:** spots that overlap the player's hitbox (`clearOfPlayer`)
   are skipped, so a player standing off-center leaves that side unblocked. Center on the block
   first.
4. **HEAL can't heal with hunger below 18 and no food** (regeneration needs 18+), so it just
   waits 50 s while monsters gather. Retreat or fight is better then.
5. **Smelt jobs time themselves with `LocalPlayer.tickCount`**, which restarts at 0 with the new
   player entity after a respawn. After a death, `Job.ready()` stays false for up to a full cook
   time. `level().getGameTime()` doesn't reset.
6. **CastPortal leaves misplaced lava behind.** After "the lava didn't land in the frame", the
   lava source stays wherever it landed, often next to where the bot stands, and that bucket's
   lava is lost. Scooping it back with the now-empty bucket before the retry fixes both.
7. **docs/lessons.md** says the scoop line of sight was "fixed in batch 7", but batch 7 (run
   36279819392 at `cabdf78`) didn't compile. The fix is still unmeasured.
8. **One change per cycle:** batch 8 (`f3f5a88`) was still running when `a68c313`, `39195b7`,
   `00fb412`, `8b9843f` and `362763f` landed on top. The next batch will measure four behavior
   changes at once (first wood trip, hiding underground, smelting while mining, shield first).
9. **Where the laptop's results are:** the user's brief for this session puts them on
   `laptop/opus-and-tooling` (this file, and a "Local runs" section in `docs/batches.md`), not on
   `claude/laptop-results` / `docs/laptop-results.md` as `docs/laptop-tasks.md` expects.

## Notes

- `docs/batches.md`: the "Local runs" section goes above the cloud table, because
  `scripts/cycle` appends its rows at the end of the file.
